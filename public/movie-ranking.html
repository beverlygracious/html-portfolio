<h1>Best Movies According to Beverly</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>

<p>For someone who enjoys art and music, this movie is a delight. The art style is just chefs kisses and the music just blends in with every scene to make it an adventure for the viewer.</p>
<h3>Miracle in Cell No.7</h3>

<p>This one is a total tear jerker. I started watching this thinking it is a comedy but ended up balling crying at the beautiful story between a mental disabled father and his daughter. If you wanna cry, go watch this one. Totally recommend.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</h3>

<p>When the movie released, there were people posting videos online saying you will cry watching this movie and I being me, refused to believe this. Long and behold, when I finally watched the movie after completing the first season, I understood what they really meant.<br/> Once again the art style and the animation that went into this one is just chefs kisses.</p>
